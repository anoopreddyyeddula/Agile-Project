# Agile-Project
•I created an SFTP server using Agile methodology in the "Modern Agile and other XP Software Engineering" course, addressing user stories such as logging in, listing directories, creating/deleting directories on a remote server, and conducting Unit testing.
•Throughout, I alternated between roles as a Scrum Master and a developer to enhance my experience with Agile practices.
